OAK RIDGE, Tenn., April 18, 2005 -- The OSCAR working group has released 
a new version of the Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) 
toolkit, OSCAR 4.1. 

OSCAR is a software package that supports the use of high-performance 
computing by reducing the work of cluster configuration, installation, 
operation, and management. Enhancements to previous versions of OSCAR in 
OSCAR 4.1 include full support for Mandrakelinux 10.0 running on IA32 
processors. OSCAR installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux has been 
streamlined to smooth the installation. The OSCAR testing framework has 
been extended to make use of the APITest tool which makes the post 
installation testing cohesive and thorough. RPMS dependency resolution 
and installation are now handled for both the server and the client image 
by DepMan and PackMan. These tools greatly reduce the effort OSCAR 
package authors must do to install software on an OSCAR built system. 

OSCAR 4.1 has been fully tested for use with IA32 processors under Red
Hat Linux 9, Fedora Core 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, and Mandrakelinux 
10.0. Additionally, IA64 support is also available under Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 3.0.

The OSCAR project would also like to announce a new website for 
registering clusters installed with OSCAR. The URL for this site is:

Additionally, the 3rd Annual OSCAR Symposium will take place on May 
15-18, 2005 at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. More 
information can be located here:

are available from the OSCAR website:

OSCAR 4.2, expanded architectures and distributions.

OAK RIDGE, Tenn., October 31, 2005 -- The OSCAR working group has released
a new version of the Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR)
toolkit, OSCAR 4.2. this version of OSCAR has support for more
architectures and Linux distributions than ever before.

OSCAR is a cluster software stack that enables high-performance cluster
computing by reducing the work of cluster configuration, installation
operation, and management. Enhancements to previous versions of OSCAR
include a new Wizard feature that dynamically monitors the installation of
compute nodes. Additionally, several OSCAR packages have been updated and
these new packages with version numbers are:

    1. Ganglia 3.0.1
    2. TORQUE 1.2.0p5
    3. SystemImager 3.5.3
    4. MPICH 1.2.7
    5. PVM 3.4.5+4                           

Due to boot image size getting larger and the fact that many computers are
no longer deployed with floppy drives, the 'Build AutoInstallFloppy'
button has been changed to a 'Build AutoInstallCD' cd button. To reduce
image deployment time and increase support for larger clusters, the
'tftp-server' package has been replaced with 'atftp-server'. Software raid
disk configurations are now supported on compute nodes.

OSCAR 4.2 has been fully tested for use with IA32 processors under Fedora
Core 2, Fedora Core 3, Mandriva Linux 10.0, Mandriva Linux 10.1, and Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

Support for IA64 and x86-64 is available from both Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) 3 and 4. Distributions based on RHEL, such as CentOS and
ScientificLinux, have been found to work quite nicely with OSCAR but have
not been extensively tested by the OSCAR developers.

OSCAR 4.2, previous OSCAR versions, and additional information about the
OSCAR project are available from the OSCAR project page:

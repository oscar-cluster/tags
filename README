This is the general README file for OSCAR vOSCARVERSION.  See our
wonderful web site:

	http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/

The most up to date information on installing and using OSCAR is available
on our wiki

http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/wiki/

Instructions for installing this release can be found in doc/install.pdf 
and user instructions for utilizing the software installed on OSCAR
clusters can be found in doc/user.pdf.

A very basic HOWTO:
-------------------
1) download the repo tarballs you are interested in from
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/oscar/
For example:
oscar-repo-common-rpms-5.1.tar.gz
oscar-repo-rhel-5-x86_64-5.1.tar.gz

2) unpack the tarballs:
mkdir -p /tftpboot/oscar
tar xzfC oscar-repo-common-rpms-*.tar.gz /tftpboot/oscar/
tar xzfC oscar-repo-rhel-5-x86_64-*.tar.gz /tftpboot/oscar/

3) install yume (supposing yum is already there):
yum install createrepo /tftpboot/oscar/common-rpms/yume*.rpm 

4) set up the distro repository in /tftpboot/distro/... Look at
http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/trac/oscar/wiki/InstallGuidePreparing#DistributionRepositories
for instructions.

5) install oscar-base rpm
yume --repo /tftpboot/oscar/common-rpms install oscar-base*

6) start installation, for example:
cd /opt/oscar
env OSCAR_VERBOSE=3 ./install_cluster ETH_INTERFACE 
 (ETH_INTERFACE is the cluster internal interface on the head node,
 e.g. eth0).


Understanding of a new package structure
----------------------------------------
The basic idea behind the new structure is that opkgs as well as the basic
OSCAR installation come packaged in the distribution's native package
management format. This way the OSCAR infrastructure doesn't need to care
about resolving dependencies and binary package lists. Everything is coming
as RPM or DEB in repositories and is upgradeable (in theory).

Each OSCAR package is represented by three meta-packages:

opkg-<NAME> : the so called API metapackage, contains the OSCAR API scripts,
              the documentation (if available) and the testing scripts.

opkg-<NAME>-server: contains the binary package dependencies of the RPMs or DEBs
                    which need to be installed on the master node for the opkg.

opkg-<NAME>-client: contains as dependencies the binary packages which need to
                    be installed on the client nodes (the image).

In addition the the opkg-* packages we have oscar-base, oscar-libs, oscar-scripts,
oscar-server and oscar-client. They contain the base OSCAR scripts, libs, etc...

Supported distributions (archs):
------------------------

- Fedora Core 7 (i386,x86_64)
- Fedora Core 8 (i386,x86_64)
- Fedora Core 9 (x86_64)
- RHEL 4 (i386,x86_64)
- RHEL 5 (i386,x86_64)
- SuSe 10.2 (x86_64)
- SuSe 10.3 (x86_64)
- YDL 5 (ppc64)

Many of these distros are new for OSCAR, which shows that the infrastructure is now
quite flexible. And the PS3 support is something quite unique, a big thanks to
DongInn and Bernard for it!

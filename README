This is the general README file for OSCAR.  See our wonderful web site:

	http://oscar.sourceforge.net/

Instructions for installing an OSCAR distribution can be found in 
doc/install.pdf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:

  This release is specific to RedHat 7.2 and is simply to get this
  support out for what is essentially OSCAR-1.2.1 + RH7.2 support.
  The intent was to keep the changes minimal and put most other 
  additions in the next major release, OSCAR-1.3.

  + Note, the PVM RPM that is shipped with oscar-1.2.1* requires the
    users to set some environment variables in their local "rc" files.
    The following should remedy the problem given the existing 
    OSCAR/PVM installation:

    BASH users, append to $HOME/.bashrc

        export PVM_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
        if [ "$PVM_ROOT" = "" ]; then
               export PVM_ROOT=/opt/pvm3
               export PVM_ARCH=`$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`
        
               export PATH=$PATH:$PVM_ROOT/lib            # generic
               export PATH=$PATH:$PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH  # arch-specific
               export PATH=$PATH:$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH
        fi


    C-shell users, append to $HOME/.cshrc

        setenv PVM_RSH /usr/bin/ssh
        if ( ! $?PVM_ROOT ) then
            setenv PVM_ROOT /opt/pvm3
            setenv PVM_ARCH `$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`

            set path=($path $PVM_ROOT/lib)            # generic
            set path=($path $PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH)  # arch-specific
            set path=($path $PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH)
        endif

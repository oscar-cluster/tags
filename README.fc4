Possible issues from initial testing on FC4:

  1) During "Step 5" maui's "post_clients" script hangs sometimes,
     but if you run it manually (while Wizard is frozen/hung) it will
     continue with success (but the manual invocation of the script hangs)?
     This appears to be related to the init script?  'maui restart'

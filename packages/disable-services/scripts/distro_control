# This program is made to solve the problem that the postfix user does not exist
# on the client nodes when the server node does not have the postfix installed.
# The post_server_rpm_install calls this program to get the distro information
# since it addes the postfix user and group with the preinstall scripts of
# postfix rpm corresponding to its distro.
# This program prints one string of "distro_name:distro_ver".

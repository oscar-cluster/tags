# client-post-install script for the openmpi package
#
# This script is for the foolproof of setting up env-switcher's --add-name.
# openmpi-switcher-modulefile is supposed to take care of adding its own
# proper env-switcher for the mpi swither by running the following command
# during the installation of openmpi-switcher-moduelfile. It is setup at 
# post_script of rpm installation but it does not seem to work properly on
# the oscarimage according to the linux distro. 
# (FYI, fedora 7 and fedora 8 have an issue of this.)
# switcher mpi --add-name openmpi-1.2.4 /opt/openmpi-switcher-modulefile-1.2.4 --slient --force

#
# Check to see what openmpi-switcher-modulefile is installed
# 
sw_dir=/opt/openmpi-switcher-modulefile-*/share/openmpi
cd $sw_dir
sw_file=`ls -1`

#
# Check to see if mpi env-switcher for openmpi is already setup properly.
# If so, sliently finish.

    echo "Good! mpi env-switcher for openmpi is properly setup on oscarimage."
    exit 0

#
# If you are here, mpi env-switcher for openmpi is not properly setup yet.
# So, we manually setup env-switcher here now.
#
cp $sw_dir/$sw_file $dest_dir/$sw_file
echo "Re-configured env-switcher for openmpi on oscarimage. OK!"

# OK, I hope everything is good for openmpi env-switcher now.

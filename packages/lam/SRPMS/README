In case you're wondering why there's only one SRPM in this directory when
there's more than one RPM in the lam/RPMS directory, it's because this one
SRPM generates all of the OSCAR-ized LAM RPM's.  Specifically, if you 
need to --rebuild the SRPM, all the necessary RPM's will be created.

--The LAM Team


  **NOTICE**

    Summary: To rebuild on Fedora Core 4 (FC4) use the file,
      "lam-oscar-7.0.6-4.fc4.src.rpm".  This only applies to
      Fedora Core 4 based systems.
   
    Details: In order to minimize changes for the oscar-4.2.x 
      release(s) the LAM SRPM's were modified for Fedora Core 4 (FC4).  
      This included a change to the configure arguments to specify
      the newer gcc-gfortran (--with-fc=/usr/bin/gfortran) and
      changes to the RPM 'Requires:' tag to match this newer 
      gcc-gfortran.  

      To indicate these changes were specific to Fedora Core 4,
      the RPM release number was increased by one and a suffix
      was added (.fc4) so the resulting RPM's and SRPM reflect
      this change in the filename(s).
